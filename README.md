Contribution steps:

1. [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to your Github account.
1. [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) in your repository.
1. [Add your blueprint](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) to the forked repository. Make sure that it has its own folder like all the other blueprints (e.g. the aws-example-network).
1. [Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) from the branch in your forked repository to the master branch in this repository (cloudify-community/blueprint-examples).

When you create your pull request, please give us the following information:

1. Include a README.md file in your blueprint folder that describes what the blueprint does, what prerequisites are needed, including steps to fulfill those prerequisites.
1. Tell us who you are - are you a student, an enthusiast, or an employee at your company. Do you have permission to distribute this work?
1. Please provide tests if there is complex logic in any of the scripts in the blueprint.
